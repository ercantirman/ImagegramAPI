# ImagegramAPI

## Getting Started

### Installing

After cloning repository, first build the project. 

Then you need to set your database up and running. To do that you can use "update-database" command at Package Manager Console.  
(Default database settings can be changed in appsettings.json)
```
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "Default": "Server=localhost; Database=SafetyTourDb; Trusted_Connection=True;"
  }
}
```
After database is set up, you can run the API.

Swagger page will appear. ImagegramAPI is up and running :)
